A software developer with experience in backend development.

Right now, I’m exploring game development from the ground up — working on 2D games
and recreating classic mechanics using SFML (C++), SDL2 (C), and LÖVE2D (Lua).
I love digging into how things truly work: memory, performance, and all the
low-level bits that make games feel alive (a guilty pleasure that sometimes slows
me down, but passion wins over speed).

Currently learning: game architecture, ECS, and C++ performance tuning.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:

- reading fiction, literature, or philosophy
- unwinding with comedy sitcoms
- watching films that are genuinely worth the time
